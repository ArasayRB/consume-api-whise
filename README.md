#This site is made using Laravel for api connect, React as Frontend and react-redux as state management tool.

In this site we have made an app to connect to an api for make marketing process using livewire and Laravel http-client by default for endpoints connections..
and use it in react to perform action from UI without refreshing of page.

This is made beautifully using react redux.
This site is made using Tailwind css


To use this we can simply

1. git clone https://github.com/ArasayRB/consume-api-whise.git
2. make a .env file and add credential necessary (database,user, password and API connection)
3. composer update
4. php artisan key:generate
5. php artisan config:clear
6. npm install
7. npm run dev
8. php artisan serve and npm run watch and we can open the site in http://localhost:8000 or in my case i use an virtual host with address http://consume-api-whise.localhost

Note!
If you don't know how create a virtual host you can read this post:
